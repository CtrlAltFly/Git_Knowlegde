Generating an SSH key
An SSH key consists of a pair of files. One is the private key, which should never be shared with anyone. The other is the public key. The other file is a public key which allows you to log into the containers and VMs you provision. When you generate the keys, you will use ssh-keygen to store the keys in a safe location so you can bypass the login prompt when connecting to your instances.

To generate SSH keys in macOS, follow these steps:

Enter the following command in the Terminal window.

ssh-keygen -t rsa
This starts the key generation process. When you execute this command, the ssh-keygen utility prompts you to indicate where to store the key.

Press the ENTER key to accept the default location. The ssh-keygen utility prompts you for a passphrase.

Type in a passphrase. You can also hit the ENTER key to accept the default (no passphrase). However, this is not recommended.
Warning! You will need to enter the passphrase a second time to continue.

After you confirm the passphrase, the system generates the key pair.

Your identification has been saved in /Users/myname/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /Users/myname/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
ae:89:72:0b:85:da:5a:f4:7c:1f:c2:43:fd:c6:44:38 myname@mymac.local
The key's randomart image is:

Your private key is saved to the id_rsa file in the .ssh directory and is used to verify the public key you use belongs to the same Triton Compute Service account.


Never share your private key with anyone!
Your public key is saved to the id_rsa.pub;file and is the key you upload to your Triton Compute Service account. You can save this key to the clipboard by running this:

pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
